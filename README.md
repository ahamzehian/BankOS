# BankOS
This is an ongoing practice to develop a simple bank operating system.

CURRENT FEATURES:

  1. Create new account
  
  2. Access existing account:
  
      Deposit fund.
      Withdraw fund.
      Get remainder.
      Change password.
      Get statement.
    
UPCOMINGs:

  1. Unfortunately when I started this project I was not familiar with TDD. I will provide more unit testing to the project
  2. Currently you can access an account just by entering the account number, without password. A password requirement step will be added.
  3. An admin function will be added to let operation like accessing to forgotten password or account manipulation
